I studied thouroughly forward and backward chaining algorithms and applied them to develop an interactive expert system. During the process of its development I used iterative approach, but it is also possible to use recursive approach. In my opinion, recursion could be a better option which could help avoid redundant checks. Moreover, in my implementation I did not use backward chaining to ask questions interactively, however, it could be another option of optimization."
