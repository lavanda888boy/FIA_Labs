    "A `backtracking algorithm` is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired output. The `Brute force approach` tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the desired/best solutions.

In this way all the squares on the board are being filled.\n",

    "One of the ways to optimize the basic backtracking algorithm is to apply the concepts of `Domain Reduction` and `Constraint Propagation`. `Constraint propagation` is a fundamental concept in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). A CSP involves variables that must be assigned values from a given domain while satisfying a set of constraints. Constraint propagation aims to simplify these problems by reducing the domains of variables, thereby making the search for solutions more efficient.\n",

    "`Variables` are the elements that need to be assigned values. `Domains` represent possible values that can be assigned to the variables. `Constraints` are the rules that define permissible combinations of values for the variables. `Constraint propagation` works by iteratively narrowing down the domains of variables based on the constraints. This process continues until no more values can be eliminated from any domain. The primary goal is to reduce the search space and make it easier to find a solution. \n",

    "In my implementation the domains of each sudoku square are first inititalized (an empty square has the domain [1-9] and the square which contains a number has the domain of exactly that number) and then reduced using the `propagate_constarints` method. This method verifies whether it is possible to place each number from the domain into a particular square using the `is_valid_number` method and discards invalid domain members. Below is presented a demonstration of the domain reduction technique. It can be easily observed that the domains are significantly reduced which will further help decrease the number of computations performed to check possible numbers to be inserted."

    "In order to integrate the domain reduction technique into the initial backtracking algorithm it is necessary, first of all, to add `forward_checking` method. It is very similar to the `propagate_constraints` method, however, it enforces the constraints only in the vicinity of the square which was filled with a number, i.e in the same box, column and row, not the whole board. With that in my mind, the `solve_advanced` method can be introduced now. Instead of checking numbers from 1 to 9 for each empty cell, it only checks the numbers from the cell's domain. Moreover, after placing the number into the cell it performs forward checking and then starts recursive verification. Having been forced to change the domains during the recursive check, I came to the decision to keep the copy of the domains before calling the `solve_advanced` recursively in order to restore them if the game path will not lead anywhere.\n",

    "In order to further optimize the sudoku solving algorithm it is possible to use `heuristic approach`. I decided to use two heuristics to integrate into the `solve_advanced` method: `Minimum Remaining Value (MRV)` and `Least Constraining Value (LCV)`. `MRV's` main idea is to choose the empty square with the fewest possible values in its domain instead of an arbitrary square. `LCV` aims at choosing a value for a particular square that rules out the smallest number of values in variables connected to the current variable by constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically the heuristics are applied as follows: `MRV` enhances `find_empty_cell` method and `LCV` optimizes the for loop inside of the `solve_advanced` method (the iteration happens over the list provided by the `order_domains_lcv` method, which sorts the domain values from least constraining to the most constraining). The result of this approach is a significant reduction of the sudoku solving speed comparing to the initial approach. Moreover, the time spent on solving sudoku remains almost constant even if the board becomes more difficult to solve. An example of execution is presented below as well as the code implementation:"

    "Before implementing `sudoku generator` I decided to create a complete `validator` for the sudoku boards. I took into consideration several important criteria which covered not only impossible number placing but also multiple solutions cases. The criteria having been implemented are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empty** - The ultimate in `not enough input`, this puzzle contains no givens at all. To say that it has multiple solutions is something of an overstatement.\n",
    "2. **Single Given** - Originally described as `Zen Sudoku`, this setup can be considered either as the one with multiple solutions or the one with not enough starting values.\n",
    "3. **Insufficient Givens** - This puzzle has only sixteen givens, which is one less than the accepted minimum number for a classic Sudoku puzzle.\n",
    "4. **Duplicate Given (Box, Column, Row)** - The puzzle contains duplicate values within a 3x3 box, column or row.\n",
    "5. **Unsolvable Square** - It is impossible to place any value into a particular square.\n",
    "6. **Unsolvable Box, Column or Row** - The puzzle 3x3 box, column or row in which it is impossible to place a certain value.\n",
    "7. **Multiple Solutions** - The puzzle has more than one valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given validation criteria are described in more details in the article from the `[4]` bibliography link. The code below is the implmentation of the sudoku validator functionality. The `verify_board` method prints the validation error, if any occur, or just an empty string. It is also worth mentioning that `check_multiple_solutions` method uses `solve_advanced` method from the sudoku solver functionality in order to optimize solution checking."

    "Moving on to the `sudoku generation` logic, it can be noticed that it is rather simple and reuses previously implemented methods. The algorithm for generation is the following: an empty board is created and then solved using `solve_advanced`. After that, a certain number of random \"holes\" are placed on the board. This process repeats until the validator finds a unique solution for the generated sudoku. It is not necessary to verify all the validation criteria beacuse the sudoku is solved initially, thus meaning that there will not be situations with unsolvable columns, rows, etc.\n",

    "The final change which will be made to the sudoku solving algorithm is the implementation of the `AC-3 (Arc Consistency)` constraint propagation. The `arc consistency algorithm` basically performs two main functions. The first function is to check (or to revise) a particular arc for consistency, i.e., removing those inconsistent values from the variable domain of the arc. The second function is to propagate domain modifications to other related constraints and bring them up to be rechecked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm maintains a queue of arcs (or constraints) to be checked. Each arc in the queue is checked in turn and the algorithm terminates when the queue becomes empty. `AC-3` checks the consistency of each arc (or constraint) using the general `revise` procedure. It returns true or false depending on whether the domain `Di` is modified. `Revise` checks every value `x` in the domain `Di` to see whether there is a value `y` in the domain `Dj` that satisfies the constraint `Cij(x, y)`. If a value `y` is not found in `Dj`, `x` will be removed from `Di`. This process prunes the domain `Di`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implementation below differs from the previous step only by the constraint propagation before the solving procedure itself. The algorithm still produces stable and relatively fast results but is slower than the implementation from `Task 4`. It may happen due to the fact that `AC-3` requires checking arcs for each possible pair of squares on the board, as well as creating the list of neighbors. Anyway the approach shows decent results when solving different sudoku boards."

    "In this laboratory work I familiarized myself with the concepts of constraint specific problems (CSP) and the techniques for solving them, like domain reduction and constraint propagation. Having started from the traditional backtracking algorithm, I enhanced it using various approaches. In the process I learned some common heuristics which are used for CSP solution optimization and other techniques for constraint propagation, like AC-3, for instance. Moreover, I investigated the problem of generating and validating sudoku boards. Finally, I came to the conclusion that the most optimal way to solve sudoku puzzles and validate them is to use backtracking algorithm with default constraint propagation and MRV/LCV optimizations."
